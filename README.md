# Optimizing-Hardware-Accelerator-for-Image-Classification-on-FPGA

This project discusses optimizing the FPGA-based Hardware Accelerator for performing Image Classification.
The project consists of:

1. CPP Code folder, which contains the CPP code written in Vivado HLS for each of the layers present in Convolution Architecture for Neural Networks  
2. Verilog Code folder, which contains the Verilog code generated from HLS after synthesis 
3. Resource Utilization folder, which contains snippets of utilization reports for each layer generated from HLS after synthesis 
4. Synthesis Report folder, which contains the Synthesis report generated after synthesis.
